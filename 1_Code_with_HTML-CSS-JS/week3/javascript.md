# Introduction to JavaScript
- JS make you interact with a web page to create real time interaction without reloading pages.
- Java and JS are completely different languages.

### Responding to mouse clicks
- An event is something that Javascript can respond to.
- The purpose of semi-colons(`;`) is ending a line of code.

### The Console

- Objects is represent things in the program, like documents or HTML elements.
- You can manipulate HTML elements by calling functions on objects.

### jQuery
- jQuery helps us manipulate web pages.
- Example:
    `$(".button").html("hello");`
    - Sets the html contents of all objects with class "button" to "hello".

### Script tag
- Including JS in an html page - scripts means short bits of code, normally in JS.
- Create your own functions to bring together a lot of JS so you can easily call them together.

### Anonymous functions
- Function doesn't need a name.
- Functions are objects that can be used like any other object. Functions can be arguments to other functions.
