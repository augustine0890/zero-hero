### Learn to Teach Java: Sequences, Primitive Types and Using Objects
----
Get started with the basics of Java, and prepare to teach others using the free, online interactive CS Awesome textbook.  In this course for teachers we'll guide you both in learning Java concepts and skills but also in how to effectively teach those to your students.

This course will support you in teaching the Advanced Placement Computer Science A course or a similar introductory university-level programming course.  We'll begin with simple instruction sequences, primitive types, and using objects, as covered in the APCS A Units 1 and 2.  Each topic will begin by relating Java to block-based programming languages and then provide video overviews of CS Awesome content along with additional materials to supplement learning for your students.
