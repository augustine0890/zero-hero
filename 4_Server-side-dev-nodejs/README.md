## Server-side Development with NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB
**About this course**
- This course deals with all things server-side. We base the entire course around the NodeJS platform. We start with a brief overview of the Web protocols: HTTP and HTTPs. We examine NodeJS and NodeJS modules: Express for building web servers. On the database side, we review basic CRUD operations, NoSQL databases, in particular MongoDB and Mongoose for accessing MongoDB from NodeJS. We examine the REST concepts and building a RESTful API. We touch upon authentication and security. Finally we review backend as a service (BaaS) approaches, including mobile BaaS, both open-source and commercial BaaS services.
- You will be able to:
    - Demonstrate an understanding of server-side concepts, CRUD and REST
    - Build and configure a backend server using NodeJS framework
    - Build a RESTful API for the front-end to access backend services.
